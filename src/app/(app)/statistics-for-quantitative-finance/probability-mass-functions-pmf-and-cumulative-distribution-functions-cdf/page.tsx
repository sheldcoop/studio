        <p>
          We've established the idea of a random variableâ€”a variable whose value is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon. Now, we need a precise way to describe its behavior. For **discrete** random variables (those that can only take on a countable number of values), our two primary tools are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF).
        </p>
        <p>
          Think of them as two different ways of looking at the same information. The PMF tells you the probability of hitting an exact value, while the CDF tells you the probability of being at or below a certain value.

          <p>A portfolio manager holds a basket of 10 similar corporate bonds. Using historical data, they build a PMF for the number of defaults they expect to see in the next year. Let <InlineMath math="X" /> be the number of defaults.</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 text-sm space-y-1">
            <li>The **PMF** answers: "What's the probability of exactly 2 defaults?" (<InlineMath math="P(X=2)" />). This is crucial for pricing certain derivatives or setting loss reserves.</li>
            <li>The **CDF** answers: "What's the probability of 2 or fewer defaults?" (<InlineMath math="P(X \le 2)" />). This is essential for calculating Value-at-Risk (VaR) and understanding the tail risk of the portfolio.</li>

        <KeyConceptAlert title="Machine Learning: Setting Classification Thresholds" icon="brain">
          <p>A machine learning model outputs a "probability of default" score for loan applicants, ranging from 0 to 1. The bank needs to decide on a threshold to approve or reject loans.</p>
          <p className="mt-2">The **CDF** of these scores is the perfect tool. By looking at the CDF, a risk officer can answer questions like: "What score threshold corresponds to the top 5% most risky applicants?" (<InlineMath math="F(x) = 0.95" />). This allows them to set data-driven rules for their lending decisions.</p>

        <li><strong>PMF (<InlineMath math="P(X=x)" />):</strong> Gives the probability of a single, specific outcome. Think of it as the "mass" at a single point. The graph is a series of spikes.</li>
        <li><strong>CDF (<InlineMath math="P(X \le x)" />):</strong> Gives the total, cumulative probability of all outcomes up to a certain point. It's a non-decreasing function that goes from 0 to 1. The graph is a step function.</li>
