          Welcome to a new chapter. For this section, we focus exclusively on **square matrices** (`n x n`), where the input and output dimensions are the same. This allows us to ask a fascinating new question:
        </p>
        <p className="font-semibold text-primary text-xl">
          When a matrix `A` transforms space, what is its fundamental impact on area and volume? Does it stretch space, squish it, or leave it unchanged?
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a single, magical number that answers this question for any given transformation. It is the matrix's unique fingerprint. It is called the **determinant**.

      <DefinitionCard title="The Determinant: A Measure of Scaling">
        <p>
          The determinant of a 2x2 matrix <InlineMath math="A = [[a, b], [c, d]]" /> is the signed area of the parallelogram formed by the two transformed basis vectors, <InlineMath math="b_1 = [a, c]" /> and <InlineMath math="b_2 = [b, d]" />. Its value is calculated as:
        </p>
        <BlockMath math="\det(A) = ad - bc" />
        <p className="mt-4">
          The number itself tells us by what factor the transformation scales area, while its sign tells us if space has been "flipped" or inverted.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-sm mt-4">
            <li><strong>`det(A) > 0`</strong>: Preserves orientation (no flipping). The area of any shape is scaled by a factor of `det(A)`.</li>
            <li><strong>`det(A) < 0`</strong>: Reverses orientation (a flip occurred, like looking in a mirror). Areas are scaled by `|det(A)|`.</li>
        </ul>

          <CardTitle className="font-headline">The Most Important Case: `det(A) = 0`</CardTitle>

        <CardContent className="space-y-4">
           <p>
            If `det(A) = 0`, it means the transformation squashes all of 2D space into a lower dimension—either a line or a single point. The "parallelogram" formed by the transformed basis vectors has an area of zero.
           </p>
           <p>
            This only happens when the column vectors of the matrix are **linearly dependent**. They lie on the same line, so they can no longer span a 2D area.
           </p>
            <PitfallAlert title="The Ultimate Test for Invertibility">
               A determinant of zero is the definitive sign that a transformation is irreversible. Since the matrix collapses space, you cannot "undo" the transformation to get back to the original input. Information is permanently lost.
               <br/><br/>
               Therefore, a matrix `A` is **invertible** if and only if **`det(A) ≠ 0`**.

      <LessonSummaryCard title="Summary: The Essence of the Determinant">
        <li><strong>Scaling Factor:</strong> The absolute value `|det(A)|` is the factor by which any area (in 2D) or volume (in 3D) is scaled by the transformation.</li>
        <li><strong>Orientation Flip:</strong> The sign of `det(A)` tells you if the orientation of space has been reversed (negative) or preserved (positive).</li>
        <li><strong>Invertibility Test:</strong> `det(A) = 0` is the definitive test for a singular (non-invertible) matrix. It proves the columns are linearly dependent and the transformation collapses space into a lower dimension.</li>
