            Weâ€™ve spent the last four lessons building a solid intuition for vectors. We know they are the fundamental atoms of our data, representing everything from a stock's performance to a user's taste. Now, we introduce the next major character in our story: the Matrix.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just like with vectors, there are two primary ways to think about a matrix. One is simple and practical, the other is abstract and incredibly powerful. Mastering the ability to switch between these two views is the next giant leap in your linear algebra journey.

                 <p>From a data scientist's or programmer's perspective, a matrix is simply a grid of numbers, arranged in rows and columns. It's a spreadsheet. It's a table in a database. You've worked with matrices your whole life, even if you haven't called them that.</p>
                 <p>A matrix A with 3 rows and 2 columns might look like this:</p>
                 <BlockMath math="A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -2 \\ 3 & 5 \\ 0 & 4 \end{bmatrix}" />
                 <p>This is the most straightforward view. A matrix is just a way of organizing data. More specifically, a matrix is a collection of vectors. You can view it as a stack of row vectors:</p>
                 <ul className="list-disc pl-6 font-mono text-sm">
                     <li>row 1 = [1, -2]</li>
                     <li>row 2 = [3, 5]</li>
                     <li>row 3 = [0, 4]</li>
                 </ul>
                 <p>Or you can view it as a set of column vectors:</p>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 font-mono text-sm">
                     <li>col 1 = [1, 3, 0]</li>
                     <li>col 2 = [-2, 5, 4]</li>
                 </ul>
                 <p>This view is essential for organizing datasets. For example, if you have data on 1,000 houses, each with 15 features, your entire dataset can be represented as a single 1000 x 15 matrix. Each row is a house (a vector), and each column is a feature.</p>
                 <p>This view is practical for storing data, but it doesn't tell us what a matrix *does*. For that, we need the magic of the second view.</p>

            <CardContent className="space-y-4">
                 <p>This is the most important and mind-expanding idea in all of linear algebra. A matrix is a function that transforms space. It takes in a vector and spits out a new vector. When we "multiply" a matrix by a vector, we are feeding an input vector into a transformation machine, and that machine rotates, stretches, shears, or reflects it into a new output vector.</p>
                 <p>Let's take a simple 2x2 matrix and a vector:</p>
                 <BlockMath math="A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 \end{bmatrix}, \quad v = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}" />
                 <p>When we multiply A by v (a process we'll detail in a later lesson), we get a new vector:</p>
                 <BlockMath math="A \cdot v = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 6 \end{bmatrix}" />
                 <p>What did the matrix A do? It took the input vector <InlineMath math="[1, 2]" /> and transformed it into the output vector <InlineMath math="[2, 6]" />. In this case, it stretched space by a factor of 2 on the x-axis and by a factor of 3 on the y-axis. Different matrices do different things: a rotation matrix might take <InlineMath math="[1, 0]" /> and spit out <InlineMath math="[0, 1]" />; a shear matrix might take a square and turn it into a slanted parallelogram.</p>

                    <p className="mt-2 text-sm">Machine learning models learn the optimal transformations to solve a problem. A neural network is essentially a series of matrices. The first matrix might take a raw pixel vector and transform it to highlight edges. The next matrix transforms that to find corners. The "learning" process is just the algorithm finding the perfect numbers to put inside these matrices so that by the end, all "cat" vectors end up in one part of the space, and all "dog" vectors end up in another.</p>

                <p>So how does a simple grid of numbers (View #1) contain the instructions for a complex spatial transformation (View #2)? The secret lies in the columns of the matrix.</p>
                <p className="font-semibold">The columns of a matrix tell you where the basis vectors land after the transformation.</p>
                <p>Let's look at a matrix M and our standard basis vectors <InlineMath math="i = [1, 0]" /> and <InlineMath math="j = [0, 1]" />:</p>
                <BlockMath math="M = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & -1 \\ 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix}" />
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-sm">
                    <li>The first column, <InlineMath math="[3, 1]" />, is exactly where the first basis vector, <InlineMath math="i" />, ends up after being transformed by M.</li>
                    <li>The second column, <InlineMath math="[-1, 2]" />, is where the second basis vector, <InlineMath math="j" />, lands.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Because the transformation is "linear" (it keeps grid lines parallel and evenly spaced), knowing where the basis vectors land tells us everything we need to know about how the entire space is transformed.</p>
