              Ever see a headline like "New Trading Strategy Boosts Profits!" or
              "This Coffee Makes You Smarter!" and wonder if it's true?
              Hypothesis testing is the statistical tool that helps us cut
              through the noise and determine if a claim has real evidence to
              back it up.
