                The Logistic distribution is a continuous probability distribution whose cumulative distribution function is the logistic function, which appears in logistic regression and feedforward neural networks. It resembles the normal distribution but has heavier tails, meaning it gives more probability to extreme events.
            </p>
            <p>
              In finance, it's used in credit risk modeling to estimate the probability of default. Its S-shaped cumulative distribution function is perfect for modeling phenomena that have a "saturation" point, like the adoption rate of a new technology or the market share of a product.
